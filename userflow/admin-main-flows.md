## 1. Doctor Management
- **Add doctors**: Create new doctor records with name, email, weekly working hours
- **Edit doctors**: Update doctor information as needed
- **Delete/Deactivate doctors**: Remove doctors from the roster system or mark them as inactive

## 2. Roster Generation and Management
- **Generate quarterly rosters**: Create rosters according to predefined rules:
  - Following shift patterns (Mon+Tue, Wed+Thu, Fri+Sat+Sun)
  - Calculating on-call units properly (1 unit weekdays, 2 units weekends/holidays)
  - Distributing on-call units pro-rata based on weekly hours
  - Handling special periods (Easter, Christmas) according to rules
  - Ensuring fair distribution of public holiday on-calls
- **Review draft rosters**: Examine generated rosters for issues before publication
- **Approve and publish rosters**: Finalize rosters to make them official
- **Modify published rosters**: Make changes to existing rosters when necessary
- **Add individual shifts**: Manually add shifts to rosters when needed

## 3. Public Holiday Management
- **Import public holiday data**: Enter Australian public holiday dates into the system
- **Monitor public holiday distribution**: Ensure equitable distribution of public holiday shifts

## 4. Alert Handling
- **Receive alerts** for doctors who cannot perform assigned on-call shifts
- **Manage shift replacements**: Handle situations where doctors cannot fulfill their assignments

## 5. System Setup and Configuration
- **Configure rostering rules**: Set up or modify the rules governing roster generation
- **Manage email notifications**: Configure the timing and content of notifications

These flows are designed with functionality as the priority rather than elegant design, as specified in the requirements. The system focuses on minimizing administrative overhead while ensuring equitable distribution of on-call duties.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific admin flow in more detail?
