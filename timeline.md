## Implementation Timeline Breakdown (23 hours total)

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Data Models (4 hours)
**Backend (2 hours)**
- Set up XANO database with the following data models:
  - Doctors (name, email, weekly hours, historical on-call data)
  - Unavailabilities (doctor_id, dates)
  - Rosters (quarterly periods, shifts with assigned doctors)
  - Public Holidays (date, name)
- Create basic API endpoints for CRUD operations

**Frontend - WeWeb (2 hours)**
- Set up WeWeb project structure
- Configure authentication settings
- Create basic layout and navigation components
- Set up API connection to XANO backend

### Phase 2: Doctor Management and Unavailability Features (6 hours)
**Backend (2.5 hours)**
- Create API endpoints for:
  - Doctor management (add/edit/delete)
  - Unavailability submission
  - Email notification integration with Postmark

**Frontend - WeWeb (3.5 hours)**
- Build doctor management interface using no-code components:
  - Doctor list view with data binding
  - Add/edit doctor forms
- Create unavailability submission interface
- Configure email templates for unavailability requests

### Phase 3: Roster Generation and Core Business Logic (7 hours)
**Backend (4.5 hours)**
- Implement roster generation algorithm with core rules:
  - Shift patterns (Mon+Tue, Wed+Thu, Fri+Sat+Sun)
  - On-call unit calculation
  - Pro-rata distribution based on working hours
  - Respect unavailability dates
  - Basic public holiday handling
- Create API endpoints for roster operations

**Frontend - WeWeb (2.5 hours)**
- Build roster visualization interface:
  - Calendar view of generated roster using WeWeb components
  - Doctor assignment display with proper data binding
  - Simple editing capabilities through form components

### Phase 4: Notification System and Admin Features (4 hours)
**Backend (2 hours)**
- Complete email notification system for:
  - Roster generation alerts
  - Upcoming on-call reminders
  - Response handling (confirm/unable)

**Frontend - WeWeb (2 hours)**
- Create admin dashboard using no-code components:
  - Roster overview with data visualizations
  - Notification status tracking
  - Basic reporting dashboard

### Phase 5: Testing, Deployment, and Documentation (2 hours)
**Backend (1 hour)**
- Test all API endpoints

**Frontend - WeWeb (1 hour)**
- Test user flows
- Configure and test deployment settings

## Scope Management Note
To complete this project within 23 hours, we'll need to prioritize core functionality:

1. **Included Features:**
   - Basic doctor management
   - Unavailability submission
   - Core roster generation with essential rules
   - Basic notification system
   - Simple admin interface

2. **Simplified/Deferred Features:**
   - Complex public holiday distribution tracking (implement basic version)
   - Historical data import from Excel (can be added later)
   - Advanced reporting capabilities
   - Sophisticated UI/UX elements

This approach focuses on delivering a functional MVP that addresses the critical requirements while staying within the time constraints. Using WeWeb as a no-code frontend solution will significantly accelerate the UI development process, though some time will be needed to properly configure data bindings and API connections. After initial deployment, additional features can be implemented incrementally based on feedback and priority.
